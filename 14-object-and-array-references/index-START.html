      // console.log(age, age2)
      // age = 244
      // console.log(age, age2)

      // let nickName = "Riza"
      // let nickName2 = nickName
      // console.log(nickName, nickName2)
      // nickName2 = "edited"

      // // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"]
      // const team = players
      // console.log(players, team)
      // team[3] = "Mahmut"
      // console.log(players, team) // players[3] has also changed because arrays are copied by reference

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // const team = players.slice()
      // console.log(players, team)
      // team[2] = "Vahdettin"
      // console.log(players, team)

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      // const team3 = [].concat(players)
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      // const team4 = [...players]
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Riza Pehlevi",
        age: 80,
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const docker = person
      // docker.id = 78
      // console.log(person, docker)

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      // const docker2 = Object.assign({}, person, { id: 3, age: 21 })
      // console.log(person, docker2)

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const docker3 = { ...person } // available now :)
      ;(docker3.id = 213), (docker3.age = 9)
      console.log(person, docker3)

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: " wesbos.developer",
        },
      }
      console.clear()
      console.log(wes)

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)// just 1 level
      console.log(dev)
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))// deep clone but it's not suggested. it's not iterative solving.
