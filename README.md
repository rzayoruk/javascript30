# javascript30

This repository contains my solutions to the JavaScript coding challenges from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com). JavaScript30 is a free 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge created by Wes Bos. Each day, a new challenge is introduced, focusing on different aspects of JavaScript. The goal of this repository is to document my progress and share my solutions with the community.
